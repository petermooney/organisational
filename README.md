Documentation and issues about what OSMscience should do and how it can operate. 

OSM is attractive to scientists for scientific research and enquiry. The OSM Community itself may have scientific or research questions which the Scientific Commmunity could work on. The OSM Community could help in formulating the actual research questions which are undertaken. This goes towards co-created research where the OSM Community and the Scientific Community are collaborators in research. Results and outputs and delivered back to the OSM Community for discussion, reuse, extension, etc.
